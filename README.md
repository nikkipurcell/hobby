## Technology Used
This practice project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

On the main branch make changes. When ready commit your changes then do a `git push`.

## Deploy to Github Pages

When all changes have been pushed to the remote branch on main, run `npm run deploy`. This will deploy your changes to the Github page listed at https://nikkipurcell.github.io/hobby/.
