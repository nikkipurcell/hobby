# Hobbies

This is my coding project for Hobbies. To view the website visit: [Hobbies](https://nikkipurcell.github.io/hobby/).

## Technology Used
This practice project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

I have a develop branch that I use to create changes. Once pushed up, open a pull request on develop branch so you can push changes from develop to main. Main will then automatically publish the changes to github pages so you can see on the live website.
