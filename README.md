# Hobbies

A collection of my hobbies - past, present and future.<br>
To view the website visit: TBD Hobbies.

## Technology Used

I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for this project so I could focus on simple React development. I've also installed React-Router to route to pages.

## What The App Does

In this project I use JavaScript methods to filter through array and object data. The goal is to show a homepage where a user can either select a category or click the shuffle button to return a single hobby.

## Available Scripts

To start the project make sure to install package.json depedencies. From the root file run:
`npm start`

### `npm install`

To start the project in dev mode run:
### `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br />




### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
